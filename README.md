# Cross-selling-Recommendation
XYZ credit union in Latin America is performing very well in selling the Banking products (eg: Credit card, deposit account, retirement account, safe deposit box etc) but their existing customer is not buying more than 1 product which means bank is not performing good in cross selling (Bank is not able to sell their other offerings to existing customer). XYZ Credit Union decided to approach ABC analytics to solve their problem. ABC company came up with a framework which will be utilizing machine learning algorithm in the core to increase cross selling. But as a data analyst you need to inspect the data and suggest what action bank can take to increase cross selling (without using ML)
